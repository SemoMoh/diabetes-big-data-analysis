# Diabetes Prediction Analysis

## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction Analysis project aims to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes. This analysis utilizes a dataset containing medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative).

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient in years.
- **Gender**: Gender of the patient (male/female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Hypertension**: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has hypertension (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **Heart Disease**: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has a history of heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **Smoking History**: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has a history of smoking (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **HbA1c Level**: Hemoglobin A1c level, a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months.
- **Blood Glucose Level**: Fasting blood glucose level.

The target variable is **Diabetes Status**, which indicates whether the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes (positive) or not (negative).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and remove duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the distribution of features, correlation between variables, and identify patterns relevant to diabetes prediction.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualize relationships between variables and diabetes status.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and identify patterns relevant to diabetes prediction.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict diabetes status based on patient attributes.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.
5. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to better understand the relationships between variables and diabetes status.

## Results

The analysis will provide insights into the factors influencing the likelihood of developing diabetes, as well as the performance of different machine learning models in predicting diabetes status.

## Usage
